    <h2>Ted Knecht</h2>
    <p> Raise on Fox Island in the Puget Sound I joined the Navy straight out of high school. After 11 years and 2 deployments (one to Japan[awsome] and one onboard a Aircraft Carrier[not as awsome]) I left the service in 2017. After working a few jobs, one as an engineer's assistant for a carbon fiber fabrication firm and then as a tech writer for Grizzly Ind. in Bellingham. I now Live in Lynden Washington and my hobbies include CAD, 3D printing and prototyping, propmaking, VR, and boardgaming (mainly with my 6 year old son, since covid, ya know). I love making anything I love my tools and I love being in my workshop.
